## Graphs and Trees

**Tree:** A tree is a connected graph with n-1 edges for n nodes. A tree is a connected graph that doesn't contain any cycles.

**Diameter:** Distance (length of the shortest path) between the pair of furthest vertices.
The diameter of a graph is the length of the shortest path between the most distanced nodes.

**Depth:** *[Only for trees]* The depth of a **node** is the number of edges present in path from the root node of a tree to that node.
In the tree, the total number of edges from the root node to the leaf node in the longest path is known as "Depth of Tree".
The depth of the root node is 0.

**Height:** *[Only for trees]* The height of a **specific node** is the length of the longest path from that node to a leaf node in the tree.
The height of a **root node** in a binary tree is defined as the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf node. The height of the root node is therefore called the **height of the tree**.
