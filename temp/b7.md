## **Number theory**

#### Prime factor
> There is at most one prime factor which is greater than or equal to the square root of the number.
\
\
If the prime factor is equal to the square root of the number, then there is exactly one another prime factor which is the same as the former one, and the number is a perfect square.
\
\
*Proof:*
Let the number be n, and the greatest prime factor which is exactly equal to the square root of the number be r.
then,
n = a * r [ where a is any integer, prime or composite]\
a = n / r \
a = n / root(n) \
a = root(n) = r
\
\
Moreover, a cannot be expressed as more than one prime factor, as a = r and r is a prime factor. \
Hence, n = root(n) * root(n), i.e. n is a perfect square.
