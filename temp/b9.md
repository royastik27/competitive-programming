#### Destructor in OOP with C++

> It is automatically called when an object goes out of scope.

> **std::vector<T,Allocator>::~vector** \
Destructs the vector. The destructors of the elements are called and the used storage is deallocated. Note, that if the elements are pointers, the pointed-to objects are not destroyed.
